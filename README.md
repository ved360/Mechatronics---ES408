# Pick and Place Robot

**Challenge:** In the fast-paced industrial sector, time efficiency is a critical driver of success, directly influencing both production and profitability. Streamlining intermediate processes can lead to significant increases in output, allowing companies to meet growing demand and stay competitive. A prominent opportunity for such optimization has emerged within a tea bag manufacturing company, particularly in its packaging division. Currently, tea bags are manually packed into retail boxesâ€”a labor-intensive process that slows down overall production. To meet rising market demands and boost efficiency, the company is looking to automate this packaging process. Implementing an automated solution would not only reduce manual effort but also accelerate production timelines, enhance consistency, and increase output, positioning the company to capture greater market share and reduce operational costs.

**Proposed Solution:** To address this challenge, we are introducing a solution: our Pick and Place Robot, specifically designed to automate the tea bag packaging process. This PRR (Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute) manipulator is engineered to significantly accelerate packaging, enhancing both speed and efficiency. The robot features a Prismatic joint that controls the vertical movement, ensuring precise and smooth handling. Additionally, its two Revolute joints are designed to position the gripper at the end-effector, enabling it to align perfectly with the tea bags for seamless operation. By automating the packaging process, our robot is capable of outpacing current manual systems, delivering faster, more consistent results. This solution not only reduces human labor but also drives greater productivity, offering the company a powerful tool to optimize operations and meet increasing demand with ease.
